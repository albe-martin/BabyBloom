## Key Functions and Use Cases

The system has been designed to cover several major scenarios, with special handling for certain user roles. The key cases and functions include:

1. **User Navigation and Authentication**
   - **Start Screen:** Displays a hero image, the title ‚ÄúBaby Bloom,‚Äù a tagline, and a **Get Started** button.
   - **Create Profile Options:**  
     - **Create New Family:** Allows full account creation.
     - **Join as Family:** Joins an existing family with a join code.
     - **Join as Babysitter:** Sets the user type as a babysitter (_activates babysitter reminders_).
     - **Continue as Guest:** Sets the user as a guest (_disables certain modifications_).
   - **Log In:** For existing accounts (signup and login fields are validated via functions `checkSignupFields()` and `checkLoginFields()`).

2. **Baby Information**
   - **Baby Info Entry:** Uses `checkBabyFields()` to capture the baby‚Äôs name, date of birth, height, weight, and gender.
   - **Editing Baby Info:** Functions such as `loadBabyInfo()`, `enableEditMode()`, and `updateBabyInfo()` enable review and modification of baby details.
   - **Share Code Generation:** The function `generateShareCode()` shows a pop-up with a join code for families.

3. **Activity Management**
   - **Creating an Activity:**  
     - **Select Activity Type:** Choose among icons (Diaper üß∑, Feeding üçº, Play ü™Ä, Sleep üí§, Other ‚ú®) using `selectActivityType()`.
     - **Set Date & Time:** Adjust date and time fields (day, month, year, hour, minute, am/pm) by clicking the corresponding arrows. Functions `incrementDateTime()`, `decrementDateTime()`, and `toggleAmPm()` are used.
     - **Enter Notes:** Type activity notes into a text area.
     - **Toggle Reminder:** Click the reminder slider (handled by `toggleReminder()`) to set or remove a reminder.
     - **Save the Activity:** Click ‚ÄúCreate Activity‚Äù to add the activity to the list using `createActivity()`.
   - **Editing an Activity:**  
     - **Open Edit Form:** Click the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button on an activity (calls `editActivity()`).
     - **Modify Activity Details:** Change the type, date/time, note, or reminder toggle.
     - **Update Activity:** Click ‚ÄúUpdate Activity‚Äù (using `updateActivity()`) to save your changes.
   - **Deleting an Activity:**  
     - **Open Delete Confirmation:** Click the delete (‚úï) icon, which displays a confirmation modal.
     - **Confirm or Cancel Deletion:** Select ‚ÄúDelete Task‚Äù or ‚ÄúKeep Task‚Äù via functions `showDeleteModal()`, `confirmDelete()`, and `closeDeleteModal()`.
   - **Mark as Complete:** Toggle the completion checkbox next to each activity. The function `toggleActivityCompletion()` updates the activity state.

4. **Additional Features and Special Cases**

   ### a. Babysitter Specific Pop-Up
   - **Join as Babysitter:**
     - **Activation:** On the Create Profile screen, when the **Join as baby sitter** button is clicked, the system sets the user type as babysitter.
     - **Flow:** The user is redirected to the Join Code Screen. Once a join code is entered (using `checkJoinCode()`), if the babysitter flag is set (`isBabysitter = true`), the system immediately displays a babysitter reminder pop-up with the message ‚ÄúFeed the Baby Now.‚Äù
     - **Reminder Handling:** The babysitter pop-up is managed by `showBabysitterReminder()`, and you can choose to **Snooze** (using `snoozeReminder()`) or dismiss it with **OK**.

   ### b. Guest User Restrictions
   - **Continue as Guest:**
     - **Activation:** On the Create Profile screen, clicking **Continue as guest** sets the user as a guest.
     - **Restricted Actions:**  
       - Guest users **cannot add or edit activities.**  
       - When a guest user clicks on the plus icon (or tries to edit an activity), the system will display a modal stating, ‚ÄúGuest users cannot add or edit activities. Please create an account or join a family.‚Äù This is handled by functions like `showGuestModal()` and by checking the `isGuestUser` flag.
       - Certain buttons (like the **Edit** and **Add** icons) get a disabled look, and clicking them brings up the guest modal.

   ### c. Activity Reminders and Analytics
   - **Reminder Toggle:** When creating or editing an activity, toggling the reminder changes the visual slider (the small circle moves and the slider background changes color).
   - **Analytics Screen:** View statistics (such as average sleep hours, number of feedings, and diaper changes) along with a simple pie chart.
